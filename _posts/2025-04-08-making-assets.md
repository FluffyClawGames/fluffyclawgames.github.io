It's been a week or so since I started my indie gamedev journey in earnest. I have a bit of "experience" with
coding ([Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev/)) and I've owned a copy of [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/) for
a few years now. Beyond a few guided projects, some personal scripts, a text-based rpg, and using Aseprite
as a glorified meme machine, I do not have much of a background in game development <img src="/assets/images/bruhcrab.png" alt="bruh-crab" width="32" height="32" />. That brings us to today...

Now I know everybody and their brother tells every new developer to go to [Itch.io](https://itch.io/) and find some
free assets just to get the ball-rolling. The major reason being that getting comfortable with the game engine
is the most important thing at this stage and I generally agree with this sentiment. However, I didn't do this.
I spent $20 on Aseprite several years ago and I want to get my monies worth <img src="/assets/images/super_bruh.png" alt="super_bruh" width="32" height="32" />.

I decided to "git gud" at first since the centerpoint of any game seems to be the player sprite. I fired up Aseprite
and opened up YouTube where pretty quickly I found a short by [Lukas Irzl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLPPSjmRQgc)
explaining how to make a quick template for a pixel art character. This is perfect because I'm in the business of making
a game in pixel artstyle.

After a number of hours (not continuous) I came up with the following:

<p style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="/assets/images/2025_04_08_16_21_15_player.aseprite_Aseprite_v1.3.13.png" alt="player sprite sheet with various defined directions" width="480" height="256" />
</p>

I ventured on to making Tilesets with common landscapes like dirt and grass. By this time I was fairly comfortable with Aseprite so these went much faster.

<p style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="/assets/images/2025_04_08_16_38_30_dirt.png" alt="dirt sprite sheet" width="240" height="240" style="margin-right: 20px;" /><img src="/assets/images/2025_04_08_16_39_21_grass.png" alt="grass sprite sheet" width="240" height="240" />
</p>

All-in-all it came out pretty good considering I haven't been doing this seriously for very long <img src="/assets/images/crab skurred_r.png" alt="crab skurred" width="32" height="32" />  <img src="/assets/images/crab skurred.png" alt="crab skurred right" width="32" height="32" />.

### <img src="/assets/images/giga_crab.png" alt="giga crab" width="32" height="32" />  *Conclusion*

I'm enjoying my time with the art and I've been using [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) as my engine. I haven't delved too far into Godot because I spent most of my free time working on the assets. I'll be changing that soon when I implement more features in my game besides some pretty grass and a thicc player sprite bouncing around the screen. What's next?

 - Enemy sprite (probably a cute slime)
 - Introducing enemy pathing
 - Update player sprite sheet with attack poses and additional movements
