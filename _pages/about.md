Fluffy Claw Games is a one-person indie game development journey fueled by curiosity, creativity, and the joy of bringing ideas to life. What started as a hobby has evolved into a dedicated pursuit of making engaging and unique gaming experiences. With every project, I aim to experiment, learn, and share the process along the way.

Follow along as I document my progress, share insights from the development process, and tinker with new ideas. This is an ongoing journey, one built with passion, persistence, and, of course, a bit of homebrew ingenuity.
